# Phone-Book-Project
Hi! This is a rather straightforward Python program that can add new persons and their phone number. Then you can search for the phone number of persons. The program is interesting because it can build up a "database" with many people and their phone numbers and you can search phone numbers in this "database". Thanks for looking at my material!
